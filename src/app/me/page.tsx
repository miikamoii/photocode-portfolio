          Welcome to my portfolio. I am a developer and photographer passionate
          about creating beautiful, fast, and functional web experiences. I
          enjoy blending creativity with technology to deliver unique digital
          solutions.

          How I Build Things
        </h2>
        <p className="text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-400 mb-2 ">
          When developing components, I prefer thoughtful, custom solutions that
          best fit the project rather than relying solely on external packages.
          For example, I initially tried using a slider package for the
          Before/After image comparison component, but it did not behave exactly
          as I needed. To solve this, I built the component primarily using
          React and carefully managed the slider position with custom event
          handlers.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-400 ">
          This approach allowed me to have full control over the user
          experience, including smooth dragging, responsive design, and
          maintaining aspect ratios. This was a great example of balancing
          ready-made tools with custom logic to achieve the best result.

          My Approach and Skills
        </h2>
        <p className="text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-400 mb-2 ">
          I value clean, maintainable code and strive to create interfaces that
          feel intuitive and polished. Animation and subtle transitions are key
          parts of my work to provide a smooth user experience.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-400 ">
          Technologies I work with include React, Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind
          CSS, and Framer Motion, among others. Photography inspires my design
          sensibility and a high attention to detail.
